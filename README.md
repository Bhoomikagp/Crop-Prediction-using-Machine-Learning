# Crop Prediction using Machine Learning
 TOP Crops prediction


 OVERWIEW 

 This project aims to develop a machine learning based crop-prediction model to support farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, planting, and harvesting. The model was trained on a large dataset of historical crop and weather data, using deep learning techniques. The results of the model showed high accuracy in predicting crop yield, surpassing the performance of traditional crop prediction methods. The model has been deployed with user-friendly interface, thus enabling farmers to input a few values and obtain informed decisions about when and what to plant. This project represents a significant step forward in using ML to improve the efficiency and profitability of agriculture.
